### Introduction
This is a desktop application that uses the Whisper model to transcribe videos or audio into subtitles. It supports Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms.

### Features
- Transcribe audio and video into subtitles
- Download Whisper models
- Edit and modify subtitles
- AI-powered subtitle translation
- AI-assisted subtitle correction
- Play audio and video to assist in subtitle correction
- Export subtitles and video

### How to build?
- Install `Rust` and `Cargo`
- Run `make desktop-debug` to run it on desktop platform
- Run `make desktop-build-release` to build a release version desktop application
- Refer to [Makefile](./Makefile) for more information

### Troubleshooting
- Using the `Qt backend` can resolve the issue of fuzzy fonts on the Windows platform. It is also recommended to prioritize the `Qt backend` to maintain a consistent build environment with the developers.
- Since the program uses ffmpeg to handle audio and video format conversion, [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) needs to be installed.
- On the `Linux` platform, `Zenity` or `Kdialog` must be installed to open the file selection dialog.
